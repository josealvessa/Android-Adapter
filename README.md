ListView is one of the most used components in android. Very often we need to display data in a custom way to fit our
needs. To do this, we have to create an custom Adapter that is able to display all the data in a specific manner. The 
adapter provide access to date items and create Views for each item in the data set. One of the greatest advantages of its use is the capability to only create the necessary number of view to fill the screen, and reuse them as soon 
as they disappear. This project aims to use some of the best practices in adapter usage for ListView.
